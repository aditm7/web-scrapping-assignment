for MAC users:
before running the code I have assumed that firefox webdriver is installed in the usr/local/bin directory of your mac so that it is installed in
the terminal's default PATH variable. If not that then kindly install geckodriver in the folder usr/local/bin. Secondly edit the code for your username 
that is replace "aditmalhotra" by your username before running the code.

for windows users: edit the PATH in the 7th line of the program, and also add the path in webdriver in the 13th line of code.
