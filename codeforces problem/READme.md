for MAC users:
before running the code I have assumed that firefox webdriver is installed in the usr/local/bin directory of your mac so that it is installed in
the terminal's default PATH variable. If not that then kindly install geckodriver in the folder usr/local/bin. Secondly edit the code for your username 
that is replace "aditmalhotra" by your mac's username before running the code.

for windows users: edit the PATH in the 17th line of the program, and also set the PATH in the 18th line of code. You have aslo have to edit the the variable parent_dir 
in the line 11th of code, just change according to D driver or C drive etc (set path where you need output files)


note 1: above instructions were for the codeforces.py program file, for bonus tasks files the instructions are similar.

note 2: just make sure while running the programs there are not pre directories for are there for the same name
as the contest's numbers or the problems' number or the code will give error.
